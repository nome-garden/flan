1. What are 3-5 (or more) commands that you can use on terminal and what do they do? What language is your computer terminal in?
mv (file name) (new file name) = renames file
cd (new/path) = moves you to a new directory
git --help = get help on commands (i didn't know about this but it helps me!)
ls = see current contents of directory
git commit -m "(insert message)" = commit an edit with a comment

the language of my computer is Powershell, but I'm currently using GitBash!

2. Do you have pets? What kind?
I have an almost 4-year-old mutt named Iris! She's mainly pitbull and American bully though hehe. She's stubborn but I love her...

3. If you run across an error, what would your first course of action be?
I would re-read what I typed to see if there's any errors. Then I would look at previous commands to see if maybe I typed the
wrong command. Then if everything seemed alright, I would look in my notes or online to see if I was using the command incorrectly.

4. Funniest thing that happened to you in high school.
I don't remember :(

5. What is a python script? (Keep it simple)
A python scripts are files with code. They end with .py
